		<p>Welcome! The recipes on Chase the Flavors balance using fresh, colorful seasonal ingredients and creating satisfying, comforting experiences. They also champion make-it-work techniques, finding inspiration in farmers market hauls and using whatever ingredients are overflowing the pantry.</p>

		<p>Chase the Flavors is all about making the most of seasonal flavors, finding resourceful best practices, enjoying time spent in the kitchen/bar and creating handmade recipes to share with the ones you love. It's for me an adventure in developing better culinary practices and enhancing the experiences I have with flavor, sharing recipes along the way, here and in person with the ones I love. It's a place to chase delicious perfection and learn a whole lot along the way. Cheers to the journey. May your kitchen be a space full of memorable successes, shared joy, laughter, and gratefulness. Thank you for stopping by. <a href="mailto:malloryrcr@gmail.com">Get in touch.</a></p>
